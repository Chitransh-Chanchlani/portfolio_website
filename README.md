# AI-Built Portfolio Website

This repository contains my personal portfolio website, built and deployed using **GitHub Pages**.  
The project showcases not only my professional profile, but also how I effectively use **AI tools** to design, structure, and refine real-world web projects.

**Live Website:** https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/

## How I Used AI in This Project

AI was used as a **development assistant**, not a replacement for thinking or decision-making.  
Below is how AI supported different stages of the project:

### 1. Website Planning & Structure
- Defined the overall layout (About, Skills, Projects, Contact)
- Helped convert ideas into clean HTML sectioning
- Suggested beginner-friendly, maintainable structure

### 2. UI & Styling Assistance
- Used AI to apply **Bootstrap classes** for:
  - Responsive layouts
  - Consistent spacing and typography
  - Mobile-first design
- Improved visual hierarchy and alignment
- Reduced trial-and-error in CSS decisions

### 3. Code Iteration & Debugging
- Fixed layout issues and alignment bugs
- Simplified HTML and CSS where possible
- Explained errors in plain language for better understanding

### 4. Content Writing & Refinement
- Helped write concise section descriptions
- Improved wording for clarity and professionalism
- Ensured the content matched a portfolio tone
